# Import-Tracker

This is a script I designed to make it much easier to track shipping containers in bulk. It takes an input .txt file of desired container numbers (in my current role, these are generated by SAP) and drives a Chrome window to input the numbers into SeaRates.com and return the last status in a .csv file.
