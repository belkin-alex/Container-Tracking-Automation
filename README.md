# Import-Tracker

This is a script I designed to make it much easier to track shipping containers in bulk. It takes an input .txt file of desired container numbers (in my current role, these are generated by SAP) and drives a Chrome window to input the numbers into SeaRates.com and return the last status in a .csv file.

If the site is slow or the container number does not yield any results, the script will wait 20 seconds before yielding "No useful information can be output" and moving on. In these instances, I have to manually enter the container number into a seperate site (typically that of the actual freight forwarder).
